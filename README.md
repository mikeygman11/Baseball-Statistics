## Welcome to my Baseball Statistics Analyzer

This application is powered by Python and utilizes an XLRD extension to read an excel file, parse through it and come up with the league leaders in a given Major League Baseball category during the 2019 season.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mikeygman11/Baseball-Statistics/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
